# Exchange-Server-Emulation
My guide on setting up push notifications using EAS.


I have gotten Push notifications to work on my universities email address, by setting up a google cloud vm to intercept mail, and then emulate a microsoft exchange server, allowing push notifications on iOS, and other mobile devices. 

In the coming weeks I will write up a guide here in this repo, as well as share some configuration files, an possibly in the future create a docker image or create a bootstraping script to make the process easier, as it is not simple.
